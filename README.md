# MyFirstDockerImage 🚀

This is a basic Docker project to demonstrate how to create a Docker image using a `Dockerfile`. It serves as an introductory example for learning how to containerize simple applications.

## 🐳 Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
  - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Basic familiarity with the terminal and Docker CLI

---

## ⚙️ Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-first-image .
This command builds an image named my-first-image using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

▶️ Run the Docker Container
To run the Docker container after building the image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run --rm -it my-first-image
--rm deletes the container after it exits

-it allows interactive terminal access

📄 Sample Dockerfile
Below is a sample Dockerfile (modify as needed based on your use case):

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Use Alpine Linux as a lightweight base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files from local app directory (if present)
COPY app/ .

# Install any required packages
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache bash

# Default command to run inside the container
CMD ["sh"]
💡 Best Practices
Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files (like .git, node_modules, etc.)

Use minimal base images to reduce size (e.g., alpine, scratch)

Combine RUN commands to reduce the number of layers

Add metadata using LABEL for versioning and maintenance

✅ Next Steps
Add your actual application code inside the app/ folder

Modify the Dockerfile to reflect your app’s runtime requirements

Use Docker Compose if your app grows and needs multiple services

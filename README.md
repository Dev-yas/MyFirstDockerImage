MyFirstDockerImage 🚀
This is a basic Docker project to demonstrate how to create a Docker image using a Dockerfile. It serves as an introductory example for learning how to containerize simple applications.

🐳 Prerequisites

Docker installed on your system
Install Docker


Basic familiarity with the terminal and Docker CLI


⚙️ Build the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, open a terminal in the project directory and run:
docker build -t my-first-image .

This command builds an image named my-first-image using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

▶️ Run the Docker Container
To run the Docker container after building the image:
docker run --rm -it my-first-image


--rm: Deletes the container after it exits
-it: Allows interactive terminal access


📄 Sample Dockerfile
Below is a sample Dockerfile (modify as needed based on your use case):
# Use Alpine Linux as a lightweight base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files from local app directory (if present)
COPY app/ .

# Install any required packages
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache bash

# Default command to run inside the container
CMD ["sh"]


💡 Best Practices

Use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., .git, node_modules).
Use minimal base images to reduce size (e.g., alpine, scratch).
Combine RUN commands to reduce the number of layers.
Add metadata using LABEL for versioning and maintenance.

✅ Next Steps

Add your actual application code inside the app/ folder.
Modify the Dockerfile to reflect your app’s runtime requirements.
Use Docker Compose if your app grows and needs multiple services.
